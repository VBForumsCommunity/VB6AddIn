# An upgrade addin for Visual Basic 6.0 IDE is now available, created with the same features developed for the Visual Basic 6.5 IDE/VBA 6.5 SDK.  Auto indenting (pretty code formatting), scroll wheel support, forms and controls renaming, and many other code editing functions that prepare vb6 to be more explicit and closer to vb.net standard.
