# An upgrade addin for Visual Basic 6.0 IDE is now available, created with the same features developed for the Visual Basic 6.5 IDE/VBA 6.5 SDK.  Auto indenting (pretty code formatting), scroll wheel support, forms and controls renaming, and many other code editing functions that prepare vb6 to be more explicit and closer to vb.net standard.  - Run As Administrator - Still in BETA
VB65 Requirements:
1. It is required to have a licensed copy of Visual Basic 6.0 and the VBA SDK is installed on the development machine.  The SDK zip files above are stored in WinRAR format.  They were split up only because of the upload file size limitations of GitHub.
2. Install the VBA SDK 6.0 version 6.5.Â 
3. Download VB65.exe to the desired location.
4. Apply compatibility settings to VB65.exe for "Windows XP (Service pack 2)".
5. Always "Run as Administrator".
