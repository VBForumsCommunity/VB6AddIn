# An upgrade for the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE is now available as one single addin.  The addin was created with the same code base developed for/with the Visual Basic 6.5 IDE/VBA 6.5 SDK.  Auto indenting (pretty code formatting), scroll wheel support, forms and controls renaming, Start without debugging, and many code editing functions that prepare vb6 to be more explicit and more interchangable with vb.net standards and available code base. It supports a use of the language that accomodates the porting of VB code, both forwards and backwards.  Auto class instancing, and auto API insertion are in the works, as hybrid layer before/during the build process.  Detecting file changes outside of the code editor will be ported in the next upcoming update.  Compile the dll to this folder path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\VB98\AutoIndentCodeFormat.dll To recompile, you may have to close/release all instances of any loaded IDE/addins.
